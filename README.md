## Election Audit Analysis

**Purpose**: This file contains Python-based computer code that analyzes a CSV file of election results in a U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorage, and outputs the results of the analysis to a plain text file (.txt format) to provide data to the Colorado Board of Elections, that it may obtain the necessary information to conduct its audit of the election.  I am working directly with Tom, an employee of the Colorado Board of Elections, and his manager, Seth, to accomplish this task.
