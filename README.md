## Election Audit Analysis

**Purpose**: This file contains Python-based computer code that analyzes a CSV file of election results in a U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorage, and outputs the results of the analysis to a plain text file (.txt format) to provide data to the Colorado Board of Elections, that it may obtain the necessary information to conduct its audit of the election.  I am working directly with Tom, an employee of the Colorado Board of Elections, and his manager, Seth, to accomplish this task.

## Election Audit Analysis Results

The following list provides the outcomes of the Election Audit Analysis, which may also be viewed via .txt file at: [election_analysis.txt](https://github.com/deltaLyd/PyPoll_Challenge/blob/main/election_analysis.txt)
