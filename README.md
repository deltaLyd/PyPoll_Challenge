# PyPoll_Challenge
## Election Audit Analysis

**Purpose & Overview**: This file contains Python-based computer code that analyzes a CSV file of election results in a U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado (viewable in this folder: [Resources](https://github.com/deltaLyd/PyPoll_Challenge/tree/main/Resources)), and outputs the results of the analysis to a plain text file (.txt format) to provide data to the Colorado Board of Elections, that it may obtain the necessary information to conduct its audit of the election.  I am working directly with Tom, an employee of the Colorado Board of Elections, and his manager, Seth, to accomplish this task.  Those wishing to inspect the final code may do so here: [PyPoll_Challenge.py](https://github.com/deltaLyd/PyPoll_Challenge/blob/main/PyPoll_Challenge.py)
